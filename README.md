# NoAttributionPublicLicense - NAPL
License to use creative works without attribution

**Reason for yet another license**

There are already many open licenses for software as well as creative works. Each license has its own characterstics that helps users to easily identify the right permissions for their works to be shared. 

Whenever we downloaded or used creative works like a photo, icon pack, animation from a free website. The license that came along with it required attribution to its original author. Sometimes we found the authors used licenses that required attribution even when they did not really require. 

NoAttributionPublicLicense or NAPL is meant to be a solution in such cases.  With NAPL, use creative works as free as it can be, since it allows users to use, derive or modify the licened work without attribution. Infact the license encourages not to attribute the original author and the original author is ceased of any ownership or responsibility once the end user uses their work. 

**Where it helps**

* The author wants to share a creative work as free as possible
* The author wants any attribution to be removed from the work to be devoid of any legal complications arising from the end user
* Encourage end-users to derieve, inspire and modify with confidence. This is especially valid in a corporate setup.
