# NoAttributionPublicLicense - NAPL
A license for using creative works without attribution

## Reason for yet another license

There are already many open licenses for software as well as creative works. Each license has its characteristics that help users to easily identify the right permissions for their works to be shared.

Whenever creative works such as photo, icon pack, animation are downloaded or used from a free service, The license that came along with it required attribution to its original author. Sometimes we found the authors used licenses that required attribution even when they did not require.

NoAttributionPublicLicense or NAPL is meant to be a solution in such cases.  With NAPL, use creative works as free as it can be, since it allows anybody to use, derive, or modify the licensed work without attribution. The license encourages not to attribute the original author and the original author is ceased of any ownership or responsibility once the end-user uses their work. 

## Why use NAPL?

* The author wants to share a creative work as free as possible.
* The author does not want any attribution for their work, so they can be devoid of any legal complications arising from the end-user.
* Encourage end-users to derive, inspire and modify with confidence and without copyright hassles. This is especially valid in a corporate setup.
